## HasValueInRange

# HasValueInRange provides a coherent behavior accross the widgets
# which value can be constrained in a range through the `min`,
# `max` and `step` attributes of their respective targets.
#
# The `HasValueInRange` mixin doesn't provides any setters for the
# `min`, `max` and `step` properties. The class that receive the
# mixin should define them to ensure bounds validity and value
# collision.
HasValueInRange=
  # The constructor hook initialize the shared properties and
  # creates the keyboard bindings for trigger increment and
  # decrement intervals.
  constructorHook:->
    # The `min` property represent the lower bound of the value's range.

    # The `max` property represent the upper bound of the value's range.
    @max = null
    # The `step` property represent the gap between legible values.
    @step = null

    #### Keyboard Controls

    # the value by the amount of the `step` property.
