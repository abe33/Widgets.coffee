#### TableBuilder
#
# `TableBuilder` creates a table containing widgets.
class TableBuilder
    # Create a new `TableBuilder` with the passed-in `options`
    # containing the build setup, `options` being an object.
    #
    # *Available Options*
    #
    #  * `rows`: The number of rows of the table
    #  * `cols`: The number of columns of the table
    #  * `cls`: The class of widget to put in each cell.
    #    When ommited the cells are leaved empty.
    #  * `args`: The arguments to pass to the widget's class constructor.
    #  * `title`: A string that will be displayed in a header at the top
    #    of the table.
    #  * `tableClass`: A string that will fill the `class` attribute
    #    of the table.
    #  * `cells`: A function that will be called for each cell in the table.
    #    The function will receive an object containing the elements
    #    of the context. This object will contains :
    #    - `builder`: A reference to the current builder.
    #    - `table`: The jQuery object containing the table.
    #    - `tr`: The current row in a jQuery object.
    #    - `td`: The current cell in a jQuery object.
    #    - `row`: The number of the current row (0-based)
    #    - `col`: The number of the current column (0-based)
    #    - `widget`: Contains a reference to the widget if the `cls` option
    #      is provided.
    #  * `rowHeaders`: A function that will be called for each row and which
    #    return will be used as content for the row header. The function will
    #    receive an object containing the elements of the context.
    #    This object will contains :
    #    - `builder`: A reference to the current builder.
    #    - `table`: The jQuery object containing the table.
    #    - `tr`: The current row in a jQuery object.
    #    - `row`: The number of the current row (0-based)
    #  * `columnHeaders`:A function that will be called for each row and which
    #    return will be used as content for the row header. The function will
    #    receive an object containing the elements of the context.
    #    This object will contains :
    #    - `builder`: A reference to the current builder.
    #    - `table`: The jQuery object containing the table.
    #    - `tr`: The current row in a jQuery object.
    #    - `th`: The current header cell in a jQuery object.
    #    - `col`: The number of the current column (0-based)
