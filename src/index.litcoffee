Widgets are small code snippets that are executed on DOM elements to provides
new behaviors or decorates the element with new markup.

The `__widgets__` object stores the widgets registered using the
`widgets.define` method.

    __widgets__ = {}

The `__instances__` object stores the returned instances of the various
widgets, stored by widget type and then mapped with their target DOM
element as key.

    __instances__ = {}

## widgets

The `widgets` module is in fact a function you can use to register
the widgets to use in a page.

For instance, the following snippet:

```coffeescript
widgets 'checkbox', 'input[type=checkbox]', on: 'load'
```

Will call `widgets.checkbox` with each node matching the selector
`input[type=checkbox]` on the `load` event.

You can also pass a function as the last argument that will be called
for every elements handled by the defined widget after its handling by
the widget function.

    widgets = (name, selector, options={}, block) ->
      unless __widgets__[name]?
        throw new Error "Unable to find widget '#{name}'"

The options specific to the widget registration and activation are
extracted from the `options object.

      events = options.on or 'init'
      if_condition = options.if
      unless_condition = options.unless
      media_condition = options.media

      delete options.on
      delete options.if
      delete options.unless
      delete options.media

Events can be passed as a string with event names separated with spaces.

      events = events.split /\s+/g if typeof events is 'string'

The widgets instances are stored in a Hash with the DOM element they
target as key. The instances hashes are stored per widget type.

      instances = __instances__[name] ||= new widgets.Hash

This method execute a test condition for the given element. The condition
can be either a function or a value converted to boolean.

      test_condition = (condition, element) ->
        if typeof condition is 'function'
          condition(element)
        else
          !!condition

The DOM elements handled by a widget will receive a `*-handled` class
to differenciate them from unhandled elements.

      handled_class = "#{name}-handled"

This method will test if an element can be handled by the current widget.
It will test for both the handled class presence and the widget
conditions. Note that if both the `if` and `unless` conditions
are passed in the options object they will be tested as both part
of a single `&&` condition.

      can_be_handled = (element) ->
        res = element.className.indexOf(handled_class) is -1
        res &&= test_condition(if_condition, element) if if_condition?
        if unless_condition?
          res &&= not test_condition(unless_condition, element)
        res

If a media condition have been specified, the widget activation will be
conditionned based on the result of this condition. The condition is
verified each time the `resize` event is triggered.

      if media_condition?

The media condition can be either a boolean value, a function, or,
to simply the setup, an object with `min` and `max` property containing
the minimal and maximal window width where the widget is activated.

        if typeof media_condition is 'object'
          {min, max} = media_condition
          media_condition = ->
            res = true
            res &&= window.innerWidth >= min if min?
            res &&= window.innerWidth <= max if max?
            res

The media handler is registered on the `resize` event of the `window`
object.

        media_handler = (element, widget) ->
          return unless widget?

          condition_matched = test_condition(media_condition, element)

          if condition_matched and not widget.active
            widget.activate?()
          else if not condition_matched and widget.active
            widget.deactivate?()

        window.addEventListener 'resize', ->
          instances.each_pair (element, widget) ->
            media_handler element, widget

The `handler` function is the function registered on specified event and
will proceed to the creation of the widgets if the conditions are met.

      handler = ->
        elements = document.querySelectorAll selector

        Array::forEach.call elements, (element) ->
          return unless can_be_handled element

          res = __widgets__[name] element, Object.create(options), elements
          element.className += " #{handled_class}"
          instances.set element, res

The widgets activation state are resolved at creation

          media_handler(element, res) if media_condition?

And finally the passed-in block is called with the element and its widget

          block?.call element, element, res

For each event specified, the handler is registered as listener.
A special case is the `init` event that simply mean to trigger the
handler as soon a the function is called.

      events.forEach (event) ->
        switch event
          when 'init' then handler()
          when 'load', 'resize'
            window.addEventListener event, handler
          else
            document.addEventListener event, handler

### widgets.define

The `widgets.define` is used to create a new widget usable through the
`widgets` method. Basically, a widget is defined using a `name`, and a
`block` function that will be called for each DOM elements targeted by
the widget.

The `block` function should have the following signature:

```
  function(element:HTMLElement, options:Object):Object
``

The `options` object will contains all the options passed to the `widgets`
method except the `on`, `if`, `unless` and `media` ones.

    widgets.define = (name, block) -> __widgets__[name] = block

### widgets.release

The `widgets.release` method can be used to completely remove the widgets
of the given `name` from the page.
It's the widget responsibility to clean up its dependencies during
the `dispose` call.

    widgets.release = (name) ->
      __instances__[name].each (value) -> value?.dispose?()

### widgets.activate

Activates all the widgets instances of type `name`.

    widgets.activate = (name) ->
      __instances__[name].each (value) -> value?.activate?()

### widgets.deactivate

Deactivates all the widgets instances of type `name`.

    widgets.deactivate = (name) ->
      __instances__[name].each (value) -> value?.deactivate?()

### widgets.deprecated

The `deprecated` method serve to flag a function as deprecated. The
`deprecated` method creates a new error and gets its stack trace in order
to track the line and the files where the deprecated method was called.

```coffeescript
myFunc = ->
  widgets.deprecated '''
    myFunc is deprecated and may be removed in later version.
    Use myOtherFunc instead.
  '''
```

    widgets.deprecated = (message) ->
      parseLine = (line) ->
        if line.indexOf('@') > 0
          if line.indexOf('</') > 0
            [m, o, f] = /<\/([^@]+)@(.)+$/.exec line
          else
            [m, f] = /@(.)+$/.exec line
        else
          if line.indexOf('(') > 0
            [m, o, f] = /at\s+([^\s]+)\s*\(([^\)])+/.exec line
          else
            [m, f] = /at\s+([^\s]+)/.exec line

        [o,f]

      e = new Error()
      caller = ''
      if e.stack?
        s = e.stack.split('\n')
        [callerName, callerFile] = parseLine s[3]

        caller = if callerName
          " (called from #{ callerName } at #{ callerFile })"
        else
           "(called from #{ callerFile })"

      console.log "DEPRECATION WARNING: #{ message }#{ caller }"

## widgets exports

The module version is stored in the module.

    widgets.version = '0.0.1'

Finally the `widgets` module is added on global using various aliases..

    window.widgets = widgets
    window.widget = widgets
    window.$w = widgets
