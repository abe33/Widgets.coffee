# The `FilePicker` widget is a special case, since the `file` input behavior
# cannot be emulate through javascript the real target is used as the trigger
# for the widget's action.
#
# In that regards the testability of the widget cannot be guaranted concerning
# the behavior of the target. Click emulation through javascript on a `file` input
# is generally considered as opening a popup and then prevented by the browser.

        # in a stylesheet. And its position should be absolute
        # within the widget in order to cover the whole widget
        # and allow the click to take effect.

    #### Events handling
    #
    # The file picker widget is a special case, as it don't receive 
    # focus directly of its dummy.
    # Instead, whenever the focus is given to the widget, 
    # its the widget's input that will receive it.
    
    # In the same way, keyboard inputs are handled from the input
    # and not from the dummy.

    # In this regards, the events registrations methods are overridden.

    unregisterFromDummyEvents:->
        @jTarget.unbind @inputSupportedEvents
        super()
    
    #### Focus management

    # There's no need for the dummy to be able to receive the focus. So
    # a `FilePicker` dummy will never have the `tabindex` attribute set.
    setFocusable:->

    # Grabbing the focus for this widget is giving the focus to its target.
    grabFocus:->
        @jTarget.focus()
    
# Address the access restriction due to the sandboxing when used
# directly in a browser with the `text/coffeescript` mode.
